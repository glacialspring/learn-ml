**1 Introduction**
```
- L7. "Deep generative models have had less
of an impact, due to the difficulty of approximating many intractable probabilistic computations that
arise in maximum likelihood estimation and related strategies, and due to difficulty of leveraging
the benefits of piecewise linear units in the generative context."
